#### 1. Github
Head over to [github](https://github.com/) and create a free account. You may want to additionally install their applications [osx](http://mac.github.com) or [windows](http://windows.github.com). For [linux](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux) it's command line. On any platform, say yes if it asks about command line git or tools. If you want a student micro plan for private repositories, then ask [github edu](https://github.com/edu).

#### 2. Vimeo
Now to [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) and create a free account. Groups you may want to join/follow: [OF](https://vimeo.com/groups/openframeworks), [eyeo](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival), [kinect](https://vimeo.com/groups/kinect), [resonate](https://vimeo.com/resonateio)

#### 3. Screen recording 
> __OSX__ 
>> Do nothing, quicktime has you covered. 

> __Windows (free)__ 
>> [cam studio](http://camstudio.org)

>> [taksi](http://taksi.sourceforge.net)

>> [jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html)

>> possible option: [shadow play](http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/shadowplay)

> __Windows (pay)__
>> [fraps](http://www.fraps.com)

> __Linux__
>>	[Record My Desktop](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php)


#### 4. Arduino
Download the [Arduino Environment](http://www.arduino.cc/) and install if necessary. Windows may require an additional serial port installation. 


#### 5. Development Environment
Some additional help on the [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/) page.

> __OSX__ 
>> Download and install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from App Store. You may need to make an account at the [Apple Dev Center](https://connect.apple.com/)

> __Windows__ 
> Take this slowly. Be very certain which version of Visual Studio you want to use, this is not documented well. 
>> Download and install [Visual Studio Express](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-windows-desktop)

>> or [code::blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org)

>> or _untested_ C++ version of [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org)

>> or I have heard/seen success with [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)


> __Linux__
>>	You should already have [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed. 

>> or [code::blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org)

>> or C++ version of [eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org)

> __OSX & Linux__

>> [Sublime Text - OF Forum](http://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/openframeworks-and-sublime-2/11118/15) 

#### 6. openFrameworks (OF)
Download and install [OF](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/) for your platform and environment; or, if you know what you're doing [OF git](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks).

#### 7. Run, Capture, Upload
The [OF](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/) site has help per platform per development environment on how to run a project. If you're using the github repository, then follow the additional directions about how to use get and use the project generator on the OF github page.

Run any project, capture a few seconds of it as proof, and upload that video to your vimeo account. I suggest uploading a standard definition (SD) instead of high definition (HD). We don't need audio on this upload. The free Vimeo account limits your HD uploads, so save them for videos that need it. Vimeo has compression guidelines and tutorials for [uploading](https://vimeo.com/help/compression).

#### 8. Fork & Pull
Fork the ArtCodeInteractivity repository into your account. Edit the links.md file with your name and vimeo link, enter yourself alphabetically. Create a pull request of the file for your changes to be integrated.

#### 9. Read
_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 1, optional

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 2, look through and try to get a feel for what we'll be dealing with when working with code. It's ok to not totally understand it.
